 `“Without this faculty of man and beast alike to recognize identities across the variations of difference, to make allowance for changed conditions, and to preserve the framework of a stable world, art could not exist. When we open our eyes under water we recognize objects, shapes, and colors although through an unfamiliar medium. When we first see pictures we see them in an unfamiliar medium. This is more than a mere pun. The two capacities are interrelated. Every time we meet with an unfamiliar type of transposition, there is a brief moment of shock and a period of adjustment-but it is an adjustment for which the mechanism exists in us.”\r\n
― E.H. Gombrich, Art and Illusion: A Study in the Psychology of Pictorial Representation`,
  `“The artist, no less than the writer, needs a vocabulary before he can embark on a "copy" of reality.”\r\n
― E.H. Gombrich, Art and Illusion: A Study in the Psychology of Pictorial Representation`,

  `“The familiar will always remain the likely starting point for the rendering of the unfamiliar; an existing representation will always exert its spell over the artist even while he strives to record the truth.”\r\n
― E.H. Gombrich, Art and Illusion: A Study in the Psychology of Pictorial Representation`,

  `“There is no reality without interpretation; just as there is no innocent eye, there is no innocent ear.”\r\n
― E.H. Gombrich, Art and Illusion: A Study in the Psychology of Pictorial Representation`,

  `“When an artist uses a conceptual form of art, it means that all of the planning and decisions are made beforehand and the execution is a perfunctory affair. The result is a theatrical event.”\r\n
― Sol Lewitt`,

  `“Everything we see hides another thing, we always want to see what is hidden by what we see. There is an interest in that which is hidden and which the visible does not show us. This interest can take the form of a quite intense feeling, a sort of conflict, one might say, between the visible that is hidden and the visible that is present.”\r\n
― René Magritte`,

`The electronic image is not fixed to any material base and, like our DNA, it has become a code that can circulate to any container that will hold it, defying death as it travels at the speed of light.\r\n
― Bill Viola`
